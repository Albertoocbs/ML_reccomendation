**Overview**

Segmentation, Forecasting and Personalized Recommendations for a Fintech: As a group, we carried out a complex project for a fintech, the main objective was to segment customers into different identifiable groups, with similar characteristics and behaviors, in order to then optimize marketing campaigns and create personalized recommendations for each group. We analyzed about 6 million customer data and used clustering techniques such as K-Modes to effectively segment customers. Subsequently, we applied the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) technique to develop the personalized recommendation system for a small group of 10,000 customers. And on this We made an estimate of the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and according to these estimates the effectiveness of the campaigns could have improved by 30% and increased the return on investment (ROI) by 25%. We used Power BI to create dynamic dashboards, as well as Google Cloud to make a KPI monitoring proposal.

* SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a dimensional reduction technique used in recommendation systems. It allows to identify underlying relationships between different variables by reducing the dimensions of the data while preserving essential information.

* K-Modes: K-Modes is a variant of the K-Means algorithm, adapted for categorical data. It was chosen to segment customers into distinct groups based on non-numeric characteristics. This segmentation allowed to target marketing campaigns more effectively by personalizing offers according to the specific needs of each segment

* KPI (Key Performance Indicators): specific metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of actions taken. In this project, the KPIs chosen were Engagement Index, Bundle Response Rate, Definition: The percentage of customers who make a purchase after receiving an offered product bundle. Apart from the classics like ROI or CTR.
